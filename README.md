Automated Processes: The tool includes automated data extraction and index calculation processes, streamlining the analysis and reporting.
Data Collection
Data was meticulously gathered from:

**NASDAQ Data**: Information on NASDAQ indices and startups listed on Yahoo Finance.
Finder Data: Comprehensive data on Israeli companies listed on NASDAQ.
Data Preparation
The preparation phase involved creating a comprehensive DataFrame for all dates within the analysis period, ensuring precise and accurate data for further processing.
